# IQ-Test-Simulator-Using-Python
 This Python project simulates an IQ test by presenting users with logic, pattern recognition, and arithmetic-based multiple-choice questions. After answering, the program calculates a score and evaluates the user’s performance, providing feedback as “Genius,” “Above Average,” “Average,” or “Below Average.”
